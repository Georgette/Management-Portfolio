# GeGe Pincin - As Your Manager

### _Sometimes you have to get it wrong, to get it right._

Thomas Edison once said, _I have not failed. I've just found 10,000 ways that won't work._

I embrace failure because the only way to avoid failure is to do nothing, which means never trying, that leads into never succeeding. Failure is just another opportunity to learn and stay humbled.

**My Favorite Fortune Cookie:**

The mightiest oak in the forest was just a little nut that stood its ground

## What You Can Expect From Me

- **Honesty** - Never ask a question if you aren’t expecting an honest answer in a very raw form.
- **Encouragement** - I want to see you grow and be fearless
- A **bias towards action**
- **Open Door, Open mind, Open heart** - You can come to me exactly as you are, not even as your best self. We are all trying to get through life the best way we know how, and none of us have a manual

## What I Expect of You

- Know what you don’t know, and be transparent about it
- Be open, honest, direct
- Help your team; there is no "I" in team
- Give me feedback - feedback is a gift
- Ask for help
- Encourage not discourage
- Take care of yourself
- Warn me early if a deadline is not reasonable, or if unexpected problems occur. I can only manage the things I know about.
- Treat everything as if you own it. This means raising concerns, fixing things, etc.

## What I value

- Empathy
- Initiative
- Humor and positivity
- Adaptability
- Efficiency
- Accountability
- Being Open and Vulnerable
- Calculated risks with well thought out contingency plans

## What Makes Me Crabby

- **Lack of gratitude** - I live by the philosophy that if you expect nothing, you will be grateful for everything
- **Deflecting** - not taking accountability
- **Shaming and blaming**
- When I'm **out of coffee**
- Behaviors and actions that limit my ability to have *predictability* of my surroundings.

**How will you know I’m crabby?**

I’ll be direct about it, and/or avoid the trigger

**How can you help me when I’m crabby?**

I often treat grumpiness with humor and sarcasm, indulge me!

## My DiSC Profile is Energizing
DiSC is a non-judgmental [tool](https://www.discprofile.com/what-is-disc/overview/) used for discussion of people's behavioral difference. A profile defines our default personality behaviors, contributing to the understanding of how I can help those around me, and how they can help me.

**My default personality setting makes me great at:**

* The Ability to rally people around group goals.
* Tending to look on the bright side.
* Being Comfortable in the spotlight.
* Being accepting of other people’s ideas.
* Taking the time to celebrate accomplishments.
* Building solid professional networks.
* Having a knack for selling ideas.
* Showing appreciation for other people’s contributions.

**What I may struggle with:**

* Moving too swiftly and without deep thought or process, causing followers to see them as distracted, disorganized, or flighty.
* Thinking out loud, causing others to become confused on expectations or outcomes
* Having a lower tolerance for negative behavior
* Having an outward disdain for process inefficiencies, interpersonal conflicts, and communication gaps

Since I'm aware of some cons of being an energizing leader, **I am cautious but not perfect**
